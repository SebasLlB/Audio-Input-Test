# Audio Input Tests

## What does it do?
This are my early attempt to learn how to operate and set up common python libraries
which focus on audio transcription.

My tests vary widely, but all use external libraries that offer a pre-set framework
for multiple interactions, such as audio file creation and reproducing audio. 

Furthermore, as an additional challenge, this project gave me the confidence to
explore new APIs that provide multiple uses, and I have started working with them
for a personal project of mine(not completed yet).

Credits to the **Picovoice, ElevenLabs, and Openai** frameworks and their 
contributions to my projects.
